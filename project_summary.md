## Project Summary

This project simulates an H&M supplier cost benchmarking scenario. 
The goal is to detect anomalous quotations and create descriptive cost structure labels
(e.g., "fabric-heavy", "logistics-heavy", "overall high").

Key steps you should implement:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – understand distribution.
2. **Feature Engineering** – derive ratios like fabric_cost/total_cost.
3. **Anomaly Detection** – use IQR, Z‑Score or IsolationForest.
4. **Label Generation** – rule‑based tags for cost structure.
5. **Visualization & Insights** – boxplots, scatter plots with highlighted outliers.

Deliverables: cleaned dataset with tags, charts in `output/`, updated README documenting your findings.
